# more-toggling.vim

This plugin adds toggling options similar to those in [unimpaired.vim][un].
Currently it has:

  * The `y` family of toggles, `[oy`, `]oy`, and `coy`, which affect syntax
    highlighting
  * The `m` family of toggles, `[om`, `]om`, and `com`, which affect multi-byte
    formatting options
