# more-toggling.vim

This plugin adds toggling options similar to those in [unimpaired.vim][un].
Currently it has:

  * The `y` family of toggles, `[oy`, `]oy`, and `coy`, which affect syntax
    highlighting of the current buffer
  * The `Y` family of toggles, `[oY`, `]oY`, and `coY`, which affect syntax
    highlighting of Vim itself using `:syntax`
  * The `t` family of toggles, `[ot`, `]ot`, and `cot`, which affect
    `textwidth`
  * The `m` family of toggles, `[om`, `]om`, and `com`, which affect multi-byte
    formatting options
  * The `k` family of toggles, `[ok`, `]ok`, and `cok`, which affect
    `showbreak`
